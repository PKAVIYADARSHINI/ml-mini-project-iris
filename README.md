# ml-mini-project-iris:
Objective: 
        "The goal of my project was to classify iris flowers into three species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width."
Dataset: 
      "I used the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples and is often used for demonstrating machine learning techniques."
Approach and methods:

Data Preparation: 
      "I started by loading the Iris dataset and splitting it into features and labels. I then divided the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately."

Model Selection: 
"I chose the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for its simplicity and effectiveness in this context. k-NN works by classifying data points based on the majority label of the k-nearest neighbors in the feature space."

Training the Model: 
      "I trained the k-NN model using the training set and then made predictions on the test set."

model evalution:
      Accuracy: "The model’s accuracy was calculated by comparing the predicted species with the actual species in the test set. In this case, I achieved an accuracy of about 100%, which indicates that the model correctly classified 100% of the flowers in the test set
